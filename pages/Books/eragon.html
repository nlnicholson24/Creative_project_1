          Eragon was Lowell's attempt to literally just to re-do Star Wars and put in
          some dragons. Unfortunately, Christopher Paolini beat him to it, stealing
          yet another of Lowell's book ideas.
          <br><br>
          In this story, a young farm boy, with little information about his father, lives in a
          world ruled by an evil empire, headed by a powerful magical evil emperor.
          The boy is friends with the village crazy person, an old man who tells
          the farm boy about an ancient magical order of warriors that kept the peace
          before it was betrayed and destroyed from within. After the farm boy's parents
          are killed, the farm boy joins the old crazy man on his quest to become
          a magical warrior, just like the old man once did. The old mentor dies.
          At some point he meets up with a ragged, edgy side-kick, and they go rescue
          a princess who was kidnapped in the first scene in order to join a rebellion
          and a lead a strike that delivers a devastating blow to the empire.

          Did I just describe the exact plot of Eragon, or the exact plot of Star Wars?

            True to form, after seeing that people like Paolini's version of Star Wars
            with dragons, Lowell set out to write The Empire Strikes Back with Dragons
            as well. Once again, Christopher Paolini stole the idea and published the sequel
            before Lowell could. Honestly, Paolini's was better. In Lowell's version, the dragons
            couldn't fly, were very romantic and erotic, and sparkled when they went outside.
            Come to think of it, there may have been some more authors that ripped of Lowell...
            <br><br>
            In this story, we pick up a little after the first, with the rebellion
            being attacked by the Empire. The farm boy/magical warrior learns that
            to complete his training, he must travel to a far-away place to train
            with the last remaining warrior of the order he once thought to have
            been extinct. Once he arrives, he finds that the old master is too old
            and crippled to fight, and training is at first tough. But they work on it.
            Then word comes that the empire is launching an attack. The farm boy insists
            on leaving to go fight, in spite of the old master's warnings that his training
            is not yet complete. The farm boy faces an evil magical warrior, is defeated,
            and then learns in a dramatic reveal that he is the blood relative of his
            foe.
