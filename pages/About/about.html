        Lowell Nicholson was born in the year 1960, in a colony on Titan, Saturn's
        moon. Lowell's grotesque appearance at birth led to estrangement and distrust. Eventually, some real
        jerks decided to try to dump him down a well or something. It obviously did
        not work, as Lowell is not currently at the bottom of a well on Titan.
        </p>
        <p>
        Lowell's time on Titan did not last, as Titan soon ran out of resources.
        Lowell decided that the only way for  the universe to continue existing would
        be to halve the population of the entire universe. The easiest way to do that
        was to collect the six infinity stones. After Lowell gathered the six infinity
        stones, taken from the Avengers, he was able to erase half of all life from
        the universe with a snap of his fingers in the infinity gauntlet.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Avengers somehow undid that with time travel, so Lowell took up writing!
        Lowell had awesome ideas for four writing projects, each of which were
        stolen by other writers. Lowell is simulatenously proud of his work, and wants
        all to enjoy it, and he wants no one to read it, because it will profit "the
        [expletive]'s who stole my manuscritps!" It's all very confusing.<br><br><br>
