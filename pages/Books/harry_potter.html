          Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Groan was Lowell's first creation. His idea was for a little british
          boy with glasses to find out he was a lizard, than attend a magical school
          for Itchcraft and Lizardry. Then some lady named J. K. Rowling stole his
          idea, seriously changed just a few letters in the concept, and marketed it as
          Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Lowell insists
          that his idea would have sold better. Though some disagree.
          <br> <br>
          In this first book, Harry discovers that he is a lizard. Being a lizard has
          its challenges. Mostly though, his biggest challenge is that his feet always
          fall off at inconvenient times, and he has to regrow them.

          After seeing the roaring success of Rowling's rip-off, Lowell immediately
          set to writing a sequel: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secretion.
          This book both disgusted and terrified test audiences, in the worst way possible.
          The idea was truly horrible. Rowling stole it anyway, and somehow turned
          it into something decent. Who knows how she did it. Thankfully Lowell stopped
          writing this awful series.

          In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secretion, Harry the Lizard boy must
          find a secret chamber inside a bathroom where they distribute a secret tanning
          lotion.
